### Prototyping with Purpose: Node-RED 

- To get started with Node-RED, refer to my web site http://ibmcloud-watson-day.mybluemix.net/     
- For ease of use, I wrote this Db2 for i in Node-RED :    https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-db2-for-i
- This tutorial (IBM i or other platforms) for  [Node-RED & Db2 for i with Watson](https://ibmcloud-watson-day.mybluemix.net/files/Lab.Node-RED-SocialDashboard.pdf)
- Reference docs: 
  - First of all, an excellent article for installing Node-RED on IBM i  https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/i-running-node-red/
